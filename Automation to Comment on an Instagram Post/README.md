Automation to Comment on an Instagram Post

Objective:        

To build a program capable of automate comments posted on Instagram.         
When the program is running, the user will type the message he wants to comment, the name of the profile where he will comment and how many comments he will post.     
The program will always comment in the latest post of the Instagram profile chose by the user.          

Important Details:           

I used the Windows 10 operational system to run this code, so it's possible that it won't run in some operational systems, such as Linux and Mac.        
The code's explanation is already in the file attached.      
Probably the zoom's size on Google Chrome is going to change the efficiency of the program, so the recomendation is zoom at 110%.
